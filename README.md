cj-explorer
===========

A generic explorer client for collection+json servers.

Note: since this an HTML+JS client, you'll run into CORS[1] trouble before too long. You can get around this by:
 #. Make sure the cj server you are pinging supports the proper CORS response
_(TK)_
 #. Make sure the client app is hosted on the same server as cj data.
